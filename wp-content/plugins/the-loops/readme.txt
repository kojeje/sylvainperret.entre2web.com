Like Drupal Views but for WordPress, The Loops allows you to query the
database for content and display it in a page without having to write
php code.

== Description ==
The Loops plugin offers you great flexibility for displaying your site
content and users list. It provides a graphical user interface in your
WordPress site admin that allows you to query the database for content
without having to write any PHP code or SQL queries.

With this plugin, you can display the queried content in a page or post
(using shortcodes) or a widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How to use? =

Click on the \'Loops\' link in the \'Appearance\' menu, click \'Add New\' to
add a new loop. Use the shortcode provided or go to the widgets screen
to add the loop to a sidebar.

= How to add custom templates? =

Copy a default template file from the directory \'tl-templates\' in the
plugin directory to your theme directory. Then feel free to modify it to
your liking!

Copy a default template file from the directory \'tl-templates\' in the
plugin directory to your theme directory. Then feel free to modify it to
your liking!

The template\'s header must contain the line:
	 * The Loops Template: List of excerpts

= How to add register custom templates directories ? =

Use a function hooked on filter \"tl_templates_directories\" eg.

	add_filter(\'tl_templates_directories\',my_plugin_tl_templates_directory);

	function my_plugin_tl_templates_directory($directories){
		$directories[]=MYPLUGIN_ABSOLUTE_DIR; //change this to the absolute directory you want to be checked for templates
		return $directories;
	}

The Loops will then check in MYPLUGIN_ABSOLUTE_DIR if there is valid templates which it can use; and they will be available through The Loops options.
